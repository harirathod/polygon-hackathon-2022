# polygon-blockchain-hackathon-2022

## Overview

The aim of my team's project in this hackathon was to create an initiative that would allow community services with the greatest individual support to receive the greatest funding from the government and sponsors, using the idea of quadratic funding.

I designed the website, using Adobe Photoshop, that lists the services which people can contribute funds for.
